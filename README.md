# A monophonic additive synth written in Javascript.

Or: a carefully hand-made (unfinished) port from [Sorollet](http://github.com/sole/sorollet). Uses the Web Audio API.

This is a work in progress, as you might have guessed already.

## Examples

If you want to have a listen, open the example in the ````examples```` folder (yes, there's only one example at the time being, I'm afraid).
Or open [this page](http://5013.es/toys/sorollet/examples/01_listen_world) in your Web Audio API capable browser (mostly Chrome|ium).

[MACCHINA I](http://5013.es/toys/macchina) uses Sorollet.js too.
